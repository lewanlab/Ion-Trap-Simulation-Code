# Verify Secular Motion Frequencies

These scripts verify that the secular motion frequencies of a single trapped ion are in agreement with theoretical predictions.
To run the test, run either SecularFrequencies_fullRF (for a full rf simulation) or SecularFrequencies_pseudoPot (for a simulation using the pseudopotential approximation).

The graph used in the paper can be created by running PlotPaperGraph.m
